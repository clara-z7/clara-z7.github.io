What poaching is, is the illegal hunting and killing of animals. Whaling is the poaching of whales. The reason why whales are being slaughtered is for their meat (for commercial whaling), to reduce competition for fish, for their teeth (used as currency in some places), and for oil. Poaching gained popularity in the 1960s, which led to the decline of several whale populations at that time. As a consequence of these actions, in 1986 the International Whaling Commission, the IWC, banned commercial whaling. However, in some places, such as Iceland, Japan and Norway it is still happening to this day.  As of now, 7 out of the 13 species of large whales are either endangered or vulnerable. If enough people learned about, it could cause costly damages, so instead of simply stopping countries have developed various methods of concealment. Japan, for instance, launched a scientific whaling program (meaning the whales are killed for "science" but then sold for cheap to encourage consumption). Whereas Norway found and used a loophole in the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Whereas Norway, on the other hand, discovered and took advantage of a loophole in the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. The reason why whaling is so popular is because it is difficult to locate vessels in the vast sea. On these vessels, harpoons are fired into the water and sometimes they are filled with penthrite grenades. Other times they use high-powered riffles. Whales are only a fraction of the animals that are being killed. Dolphins and many types of turtles are among the other creatures targeted for poaching. For instance, dolphin hunters can get $32,000 or less for a live dolphin, while trained dolphins can cost up to $300,000. While dolphin meat can cost around 600$. This gives people a reason to try to poach them. The reasons why poaching is fatal to the marine world is because it threatens biodiversity (for example in Iceland they killed 148 endangered fin whales alone in 2010). The reason why biodiversity is so important is because it causes problems in the food chain (our primary food source). Beside that it also cause economic damages.</p></div>

<td align="center" style="background-color: #2D3049; border-radius: 5px; width: 642px; font-family: avenir; font-size:16px;"> <h2>Overfishing</h2>
  <p style="width: 600px;"> Overfishing is when fish are removed from a body of water faster than they can reproduce. Ecosystems deteriorate as a result of overfishing. It has an impact on fish populations, the frequently at which they reproduce, and the speed at which they mature. Too many fish taken out of a body of water creates an imbalance in the food chain and web. For example, if too many predators are removed it causes problems further down in the food chain. If there are almost no predators left, the population below them overpopulates and eats all of the one even further down. Then since they have no food, they die. This process will repeat itself over and over again. Removal of predators can also cause collateral damage. Sharks and big marine wildlife bring fish up to the surface, which means if there are less sharks less fish swims to the surface. Therefore, sea birds have a harder time finding food. In the last few decades seabirds’ populations have decreased by 70%. Beside affecting the fauna, it is also affecting the flora. Take algae as an example. Algae are essential as they provide food for animals, produce more oxygen than trees and much more, however if it grows excessively, it causes destruction and damage to both fish and coral reefs. Overfishing has also a tendency to suck in a lot of other problems. For instance, overfishing also causes a lot economical damage. A $42 billion tuna industry was risking collapse due to overfishing blue fin tuna to the point that there is less the 3% left. To cover stuff like this up they kill dolphins and say they are doing it as they “eat to much tuna”. Once again though we are not only talking money wise but also people wise. Overexploiting fish stocks causes unemployment, and it can cost up to 100,000 jobs. In general overfishing has been disasters in the marine world a lot of marine animals are on the brink of extinction due to it.</p></td>


<td align="center" style="background-color: #2D3049; border-radius: 5px; width: 642px;">  <h2>Climate Change</h2><p style="width: 600px;">Climate change is another aspect that has an impact on marine species. For instance, North Sea cod population have decreased, while overall cod populations have declined by 86%. Climate change has been affecting the sea by making weather patterns unpredictable. This includes and affects storm patterns, ocean currents, and it is also causing acidification. Marine heatwaves have increased more than 50% in the past 30 years as a result of climate change, and by 2100, ocean temperatures are expected to rise by 1 to 4 degrees Celsius. This is because the ocean absorbs atmospheric heat and greenhouse gasses (e.g Carbon Dioxide). Over the last 10 years, it is estimated that the ocean absorbed 90% of warming and 1/4 of carbon dioxide emissions. As previously mentioned, climate change has also contributed to ocean acidification. Acidification is similarly caused by the ocean absorbing carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide forms various chemical reaction which causes the pH of the ocean to lower. The acidity results in lesser carbonate ions, which are needed to build the shells, the skeletons of corals, oysters, crabs, and other organisms. Moreover, it causes acidosis, abnormal growth and impairment of fishes' internal chemistry. Beside affecting them directly it also affects their environment. All of this together has affected fishes' spawning capabilities as their habitats are gradually becoming unsuitable. This is because the structure of ecosystems and the distribution of fish populations are altered by the higher temperatures, meaning that sometimes they lack food. For example, Pacific Salmon is one of the species that's getting affected. They are now swimming in warmer and less oxygenated waters. Luckily, as of now, they are seeing increases in the biodiversity in the North Atlantic and North Pacific ocean, which hopefully means we might be doing something right. However, it is anticipated that the potential seafood catch may decline by 2050 if we continue like this.</p></td>

Pollution is another lethal factor when talking about fish as it causes various diseases such as fin/tail rot, gill disease, liver damage, ulceration and much more. One of the main things that pollution causes is bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation is basically the gradual buildup of chemical and substances. It happens when an organism absorbs a substance faster than the substance can get out of their body, and as the body can’t process it, it becomes toxic. Microplastics as well is a dangerous substance for fish. Because it looks like plankton, fish eat it however, instead of ingesting needed nutrients, they end up swallowing dangerous chemicals. Microplastics affects their energy levels and their ability to reproduce, sometimes cause an imbalance in a specific marine species’ population. Microplastics can be one of the substances causing bioaccumulation. Oil spills are also threatening to a fish’s life. It causes reduce growth, enlarged livers, changes in heart and respiration rates, fin erosion and reproduction impairment. What is most affected and sensitive to this however are the fish eggs and the larvae. In addition to this pollution can also cause oxygen to lack in certain places. This is because the debris uses the oxygen to degrade. Low levels of oxygen can cause death to many fish, especially whales. When too many oxygen depletions occur in the ocean it causes a dead zone, where no organism can survive. </p></div>

<td align="center" style="background-color: #2D3049; border-radius: 5px; width: 642px;"> <h2>Bycatch</h2> <p style="width:600px;">Bycatch is another thing that is slowly killing numerous species. Bycatch occurs when additional marine life is caught while attempting to catch a specific species. This leads to a lot of the fish getting discarded. Around 40% of fish is bycatch and is dead before it is thrown in the water. As a result of bycatch, the food chain is disrupted. This is because prey, that other fish rely on, start slowly lacking. Basically, it makes prey less accessible for them, to put it succinctly. Moreover, bycatch also causes damage to protected corals and contributes to overfishing. For example, one tuna boat caught 45 dolphins just to catch 8 tunas. Due to this, it also impedes population recovery. This plus the fact that animals need to swim to the surface to take a breath, research indicates that bycatch is more fatal to marine wildlife than any other human activity. Over 300,000 porpoises, dolphins and other marine animals are killed by bycatch every year. Additionally, bycatch reduces the potential yield of fisheries not only moneywise but also jobwise. It loses over 64,000 jobs and over 6 billion dollars.</p></td>
<td align="center" style="background-color: #2D3049; border-radius: 5px; width: 642px;"> <h2>Fishing Nets</h2> <p style="width:600px;"> Even though fishing nets are part of pollution, they need to be brought up more often and therefore they have their own section. Fishing nets are the biggest fish killers. Fishing nets make up over 46% of the garbage patch and most of the rest is fishing gear. This is more dangerous than any other plastics, as fishing gear and nets are designed to kill. Fishing nets also cause a lot of sea floor damage, due to the heavy weights at the bottom. This leads to sea floor deforestation, which currently is at 3.9 billion acres due to this and trawling. To put a comparison beside that, each year we cut down 25 million acres of forests. The majority of the trash detected in the whales' stomachs is fishing nets and equipment. Fishing nets as garbage in the ocean, are not talked about enough. On social media we mainly talk about plastic, mainly straws which only make up 0.03% of the plastic/garbage that enters the ocean. Fishing nets should become a priority.</p> </td>

Boat collisions is when two boats run into each other and clash. When this happens it cause pollution. Chemicals form the paint used to paint the boat go into the water and sometime the oil leaks, negatively affecting the marine wildlife and the environment. Moreover it causes noise pollution. Noise pollution might not seem as important but it is. It cause wildlife to stress out, they might loose hearing and change their behaviors. </p></div>
